# Rangefinder
An arduino project that measures the range to an object by using an ultrasonic rangefinder and displays the range on an LCD and also relays that distance to a remote device.
<br>Features:
	<br>• An ultrasonic rangefinder for measuring distances up to 400cm.
	<br>• Buttons to initiate a range measurement and set distance thresholds.
	<br>• An LCD display for showing the measured range. The display is also used for setting the distance
thresholds and displaying the distance received from the remote device.
	<br>• A control knob for setting the local and remote distance thresholds.
	<br>• Two LEDs for showing whether the measured distance is less than or greater than a threshold.
	<br>• A buzzer for playing an alarm tone.
	<br>• A serial interface to another rangefinder unit. When the local unit measures a distance it sends it to
the remote unit. When a distance is received from the remote unit it is displayed on the LCD.
