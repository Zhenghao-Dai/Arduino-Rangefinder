# Rangefinder
An arduino project that measures the range to an object by using an ultrasonic rangefinder and displays the range on an LCD and also relays that distance to a remote device.

Features:
• An ultrasonic rangefinder for measuring distances up to 400cm.
• Buttons to initiate a range measurement and set distance thresholds.
• An LCD display for showing the measured range. The display is also used for setting the distance
thresholds and displaying the distance received from the remote device.
• A control knob for setting the local and remote distance thresholds.
• Two LEDs for showing whether the measured distance is less than or greater than a threshold.
• A buzzer for playing an alarm tone.
• A serial interface to another rangefinder unit. When the local unit measures a distance it sends it to
the remote unit. When a distance is received from the remote unit it is displayed on the LCD.
